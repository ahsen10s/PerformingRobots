**Presentation 1 question**
\n
Why are we so obsessed with mimicking human realism with robots? Humans already exist. Would it not be better to explore themes only robots perform? Our obsession with anthropomorphising touches all we do.
\n
**Presentation 2 question**
\n
Toomie said that people's initial response from seeing the ultra realistic robot, was worry and unease. They got more relaxed after spending some time with it. Could it be that they were tense at first from seeing it mimic humans so closely and gradually relaxed after seeing it fail to talk exactly like humans? Are we instinctually afraid of being copied by something not us?

In class, we started building the foundation of our performing robot. Pranav and I went with the standard 2 motorized set-up recommended in class. We first sauldered single-core wires to our two servos to have longer cables to work with. Next, we picked out a wooden foundation to build Mrs.Peacock on, and got to puting our mounts, motors, and wheels together. We drilled the motors on opposing sides of the square foundation, center each of each side. To keep the plaque balanced, we drilled a free-spinning wheel on the adjacent side.

However, we will likely have to redo the free-spinning wheel, since we did not adjust for the added height of the larger motorized wheel. Perhaps we shall drill a small wooden block to the underside of our foundation, which we will then use to drill the free-spinning wheel into.

### Initial Thoughts
For this play, above all else, I want to create a memorable character. One that, by the end of the play, teh audience will leave with a clear. complete picture off. With the play runtime being 20 minutes, each character will get roughly two and a half minutes to speak and establish their character. Given the limitation, as well as the inherent clunkiness of having robot actors, my robot will have to have an extreme personality and voice to grab the audience's attention. While subtle nuances in character development is always appreciated in theatre, our compact play is perhaps not the best venue for that.

### Character
We chose Mrs.Peacock.
“Character description (Open for change) - Mrs. Peacock is the wife of an unidentified Senator. She has been taking bribes for an undisclosed amount of time, though she winds up paying some of that money to Mr. Boddy, who discovered her secret thanks to the cook they share. She murders said cook in two of the versions, and in one, she murders every single person because that’s what vindictive old women who think they’re better than everyone else do.

Quality Of Character: It’s all about the sighs with Mrs. Peacock, as handled by Eileen Brennan. She’s great at expressing disapproval without using real words to do it. She’s of that not rare enough breed who thinks her own sins are completely legitimate but those of others are immoral, offensive and scuzzy. This leads to some pretty defensive comments about her own bribe-taking and some pretty offensive statements and mean-spirited looks about things like homosexuality, prostitution and murder.”
