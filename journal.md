#Initial Thoughts
For this play, above all else, I want to create a memorable character. One that, by the end of the play, teh audience will leave with a clear. complete picture off. With the play runtime being 20 minutes, each character will get roughly two and a half minutes to speak and establish their character. Given the limitation, as well as the inherent clunkiness of having robot actors, my robot will have to have an extreme personality and voice to grab the audience's attention. While subtle nuances in character development is always appreciated in theatre, our compact play is perhaps not the best venue for that.

##Character
I chose Mrs.Peacock.
Character description - Her mannerisms are grandiose; from sweeping tail feathers to exaggerated laughs, she is a woman of spectacle, and her love for being the center of attention is apparent in every interaction. She insists on only the finest—be it company, or compliments—and has a habit of looking down her nose at anything or anyone she deems inferior, which, in her mind, is most people.

I can convey a lot about her personality through her exterior visage. She will be colorful and vibrant just like her personality. She will have a Chinese foldable fan that opens and closes, to mimic the tail feathers that real peacocks have. Ideally it too will be made from bird feathers, to convey the wealth and affluence of Mrs.Peacock. Maybe we give her a monocle too.
