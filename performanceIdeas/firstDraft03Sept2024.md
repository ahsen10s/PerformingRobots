Pride and Prejudice
Plot: A comedic and clunkier version of "Pride and Prejudice," but all the characters are robots experiencing human emotions for the first time. Elizabeth Bennet is an AI learning sarcasm and wit, while Mr. Darcy is a sophisticated but emotionally awkward robot who needs an upgrade to express his feelings properly.

The 7 robots can play the 7 characters in the movie with the most screentime:

Elizabeth Bennet is a witty, quick-thinking robot with a sleek, efficient design that allows her to express sarcasm and humor in different tones. She uses rapid head tilts and eyebrow LED flashes to convey skepticism and amusement.
Mr. Darcy is an elegantly designed robot with a tall, imposing frame. Initially stiff and reserved in his movements, his exterior is polished to a mirror-like finish, representing his pride and high status. Over time, his movements become more fluid and expressive as he learns to navigate his emotions.
Mrs. Bennet is a robot with an exaggerated, flamboyant design and an overly bright color palette, symbolizing her overly dramatic personality. She has multiple mechanical arms that flail wildly whenever she gets anxious or excited.
Mr. Bennet is a slightly older model robot with a dry, understated design. He has a weathered exterior but a charming smile that lights up his LED face. He moves slowly and deliberately, often staying in the background to observe.
